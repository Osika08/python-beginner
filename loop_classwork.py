### Task 1: print the element of a list
#For loop:
#write a program that iterates over a list of numbers and prints each number.
numbers= [10, 4, 6, 8, 20]
#for num in number:
   # print(num)

#WHILE LOOP:
#write the same program using  a 'while' loop instead of a 'for' loop.
x = 0
while x < len(numbers):
     print(numbers)
     print(numbers[x])
     x = x + 1
